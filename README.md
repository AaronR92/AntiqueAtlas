Antique Atlas
=============

Adds item Antique Atlas. It's like a fancy antique-looking map, which saves all visited locations so you can browse them.
Maps are generated around the player based on chunk-average biome. All data is saved on the server.

TODO
====
* Export the map in PNG
* Redraw textures for sand and plains. Consider using wavy lines for sand. Plains have to look more distinct from unexplored regions.
* The config file should only rewrite itself when biomes are missing from it or so.
* Make the arrow buttons disappear when the mouse is not around them, because they look kinda ugly compared to the map.
