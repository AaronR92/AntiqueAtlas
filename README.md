Antique Atlas
=============

Adds item Antique Atlas. It's like a fancy antique-looking map, which saves all visited locations so you can browse them.
Maps are generated around the player based on chunk-average biome. All data is saved on the server.

TODO
====
* Redraw textures for plains. Plains have to look more distinct from unexplored regions.
