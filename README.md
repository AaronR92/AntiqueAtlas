Antique Atlas
=============

Adds item Antique Atlas. It's like a fancy antique-looking map, which saves all visited locations so you can browse them.
Maps are generated around the player based on chunk-average biome. All data is saved on the server.

You can export the contents of an Atlas in the current dimension to a PNG image.
